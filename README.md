# Vehicular Intruder System on ESP32

Just another intruder detection system with ESP32 and standard Bluetooth.

Just a barebones test code as of now. Additional functionalities will be added soon.

Prerequisites:
- ESP32
- MPU6050 IMU Sensor
- Relays

~~I dunno tho, nothing makes sense anymore.~~

Kinda makes a bit more sense now.
Now there's a basic Android app as well! 

Right now we aren't pulling anything from the ESP32 yet though. It's just to connect, open a dashboard and display a basic speedometer using GPS.
